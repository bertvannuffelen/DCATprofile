  <h2>Agent Roles</h2>

<p>
The DCAT Application Profile specified in this document has a single property to relate an Agent (typically, an organisation) to a Dataset. The only such ‘agent role’ that can be expressed in the current version of the profile is through the property dct:publisher (http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher), defined as “An entity responsible for making the dataset available”. A second property is available in the DCAT recommendation, dcat:contactPoint (http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#Property:dataset_contactPoint), defined as “Link a dataset to relevant contact information which is provided using VCard”, but this is not an agent role as the value of this property is contact data, rather than a representation of the organisation as such.
In specific cases, for example in exchanging data among domain-specific portals, it may be useful to express other, more specific agent roles. In such cases, extensions to the base profile may be defined using additional properties with more specific meanings.
</p><p>
Two possible approaches have been discussed, particular in the context of the development of the domain-specific GeoDCAT Application Profile, an extension of the base DCAT Application Profile. 
The first possible approach is based on the use of a predicate vocabulary that provides a set of properties that represent additional types of relationships between Datasets and Agents. For example, properties could be defined, such as foo:owner, foo:curator or foo:responsibleParty, in addition to the use of existing well-known properties, such as dct:creator and dct:rightsHolder. A possible source for such additional properties is the Roles Named Authority List  maintained by the Publications Office of the EU. Other domain-specific sources for additional properties are the INSPIRE Responsible Party roles , the Library of Congress’ MARC relators  and DataCite’s contributor types . To enable the use of such properties, they must be defined as RDF properties with URIs in a well-managed namespace. 
</p><p>
A second approach is based on the use of W3C’s PROV ontology  which provides a powerful mechanism to express a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. In the context of work on GeoDCAT-AP, a PROV-conformant solution for expressing agent roles was agreed . This solution uses prov:qualifiedAttribution in combination with a dct:type assertion pointing to the code list for Responsible Party Role in the INSPIRE registry. To enable the use of such types, they must be defined with URIs in a well-managed namespace. 
</p><p>
Based on the experience gained with the use of domain-specific extensions for additional ‘agent roles’ in the exchange of information about Datasets and on the requests of implementors and stakeholders, the  DCAT Application Profile release 2.0.0 is  extended with additional roles as proposed by DCAT Version 2, W3C Working Draft 28 May 2019  that have proven to be useful across domains. Precisely, properties dct:creator, prov:qualifiedAttribution and dcat:qualifiedRelation have been added to dcat: dataset class to further facilitate relationships between datasets and agents. 
</p><p>
It should be noted that, even if a more expressive approach is used in a particular implementation, the provision of information using dct:publisher for the Catalogue is still mandatory under the rules laid down in the Conformance Statement in section 6, while the provision of information using dct:publisher is strongly recommended for Dataset. The provision of such information using dct:publisher will ensure interoperability with implementations that use the basic approach of DCAT-AP.
