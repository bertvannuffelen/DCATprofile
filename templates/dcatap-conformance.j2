In addition to the mandatory properties, any of the recommended and optional properties defined in section 4 MAY be provided.
Recommended and optional classes may have mandatory properties, but those only apply if and when an instance of such a class is present in a description.
<h3>Receiver requirements</h3>
In order to conform to this Application Profile, an application that receives metadata MUST be able to:
<li>Process information for all classes specified in section 3.</li>
<li>Process information for all properties specified in section 4. </li>
<li>Process information for all controlled vocabularies specified in section 5.2.</li>
As stated in section 3, "processing" means that receivers must accept incoming data and transparently provide these data to applications and services. It does neither imply nor prescribe what applications and services finally do with the data (parse, convert, store, make searchable, display to users, etc.).
