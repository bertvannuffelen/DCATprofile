<h2>Accessibility and Multilingual Aspects</h2>

<p>
Accessibility in the context of this Application Profile is limited to information about the technical format of distributions of datasets. The properties dcat:mediaType and dct:format provide information that can be used to determine what software can be deployed to process the data. The accessibility of the data within the datasets needs to be taken care of by the software that processes the data and is outside of the scope of this Application Profile. 
</p><p>
Multilingual aspects related to this Application Profile concern all properties whose contents are expressed as strings (i.e. rdfs:Literal) with human-readable text. Wherever such properties are used, the string values are of one of two types:
•	The string is free text. Examples are descriptions and labels. Such text may be translated into several languages.
•	The string is an appellation of a ‘named entity’. Examples are names of organisations or persons. These names may have parallel versions in other languages but those versions don’t need to be literal translations.
</p><p>
Wherever values of properties are expressed with either type of string, the property can be repeated with translations in the case of free text and with parallel versions in case of named entities. For free text, e.g. in the cases of titles, descriptions and keywords, the language tag is mandatory. 
</p><p>
Language tags to be used with rdfs:Literal are defined by BCP47 , which allows the use of the "t" extension for text transformations defined in RFC6497  with the field "t0"  indicating a machine translation.
</p><p>
A language tag will look like: "en-t-es-t0-abcd", which conveys the information that the string is in English, translated from Spanish by machine translation using a tool named "abcd". 
</p><p>
For named entities, the language tag is optional and should only be provided if the parallel version of the name is strictly associated with a particular language. For example, the name ‘European Union’ has parallel versions in all official languages of the union, while a name like ‘W3C’ is not associated with a particular language and has no parallel versions.
</p><p>
For linking to different language versions of associated web pages (e.g. landing pages) or documentation, a content negotiation  mechanism may be used whereby different content is served based on the Accept-Languages indicated by the browser. Using such a mechanism, the link to the page or document can resolve to different language versions of the page or document.
</p><p>
All the occurrences of the property dct:language, which can be repeated if the metadata is provided in multiple languages, MUST have a URI as their object, not a literal string from the ISO 639 code list.
</p><p>
How multilingual information is handled in systems, for example in indexing and user interfaces, is outside of the scope of this Application Profile.
